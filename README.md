#### Hacker News Formula

reference: [How Hacker News ranking really works: scoring, controversy, and penalties](https://www.righto.com/2013/11/how-hacker-news-ranking-really-works.html)

    score = (((ups - downs - 1)^0.8)/(age+2)^gravity) * penalty
    gravity = 1.8
    penalty = multiploer to implement "business rules"
    
#### Reddit Formula

reference: [redditâ€™s new comment sorting system](https://redditblog.com/2009/10/15/reddits-new-comment-sorting-system/)

    score = sign(ups-downs) * log{max(1, |ups-downs|)} + age/45000
    log -> sublinear
    the more downvotes gets, the further scores goes down
    
    
#### Smoothing

    5 4 star ratings -> 3.83
